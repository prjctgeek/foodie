Nothing. Sometimes it means not having salad, if the place has pre-mixed  greens.\nIt's not that they \"just don't like dressing\", there will be gagging.\nMany times, it takes a few iterations to correct the order.  It's exhausting.  It's hard to explain to front of house this isn't an allergy, it's a texture thing.\nAnother area where this becomes an issue is dishes where the meat is the star of the show, but much of the flavor comes from a sauce.\nFor example, pulled pork.  It's often on the dry side, and you pick the sauce based on your preferences to add both flavor and a texture contrast.\nWhen no sauce is acceptable, because of it's texture, flavor must be imparted into the meat without a sauce. This is deceptively difficult when adapting many recipes to the texture sensitive. \nThe tag for avoiding this: dry.\n\nAcidity and fermentation\nFor the purpose of the guidelines, foods can have some acid, it just can't be front and center.  Because of the 'no sauce' guideline, this is actually one of the easier items\nto leave out.  In practice, this means no pickles, no relish, and tomato sauce can't have too much vinegar.\nThroughout this site, you'll see the tag: 'gross', to denote any recipe that doesn't follow these guidelines.\nThe tags to find this is acidic, but there is no tag for avoiding it as most of the recipes are low acid.\n\nMealy, creamy, squishy\nThis one is hard to pin down.  I first came across it when trying to serve humus.  Nope, too creamy. OK, let's try straight up\ngarbanzo beans, no spice, no acid.  Nope: \"Texture is wrong\".  Testing what made beans objectionable, it seems to correlate to size.\nLarge beans, like garbanzo beans, kidney beans, etc, have a \"squishy\", \"mealy\" internal texture that seems to not be present in smaller beans.\nSo black beans were fine.  Retried beans are a gray area, with a layer of cheese or with crispy chips, it might be OK.\nMashed squash (I like delectica) is a no go. How is this different from mashed potato texture wise? I still don't get this one.\nMashed potatoes are OK. No idea why, with enough butter and cream to make them whippable, they should be too creamy.\nOne kid doesn't like the texture of rice, while the other one doesn't like potatoes that have skin on, or are sliced too large.\nShrimp.  My wife's says the little \"popping\" sensation of biting shrimp is just too much.  One kid says that a really heavy breading counter-acts this, but my usual strategy is cutting them in half lengthwise and over-cooking them, making  them \"firm\".\nFresh tomatoes are too runny/squish in the middle, and often slightly acidic, so two strikes against.\nAs long as it's in the background flavor wise, Mushrooms' texture can be masked by chopping it very small or just turning it into a paste in the blender. Using it as a bread substitue or as a base, like in stuffed mushrooms, is a hard no.\nAs many foodies recently, I've experimented with cooking using a sous-vide (hot water bath) setup.  My family will not tolerate the texture of meat\nstraight out of the sous-vide; too \"squishy\".\nThroughout this site, you'll see the tag: 'squishy', to denote foods in this category and 'crunchy' to avoid it.\n\nSpicy or strong flavors\nThis area crosses over with acidity. Of course pickles are out of the question, but even mixing in elements like capers on a sandwich or a\nsalty kalamata olive is a no go. Indian food, Korean food, and many other cuisine are frustratingly out of bounds with this guideline.\nMany fish are also in this category, as the smell is just too much. Cod in crunchy fish and chips is fine. Salmon is pushing it, and must be cooked without the skin, or smoked.\nEarthy spices, like cumin are a hard no.\nThe tag strong is used for this guideline, but most of the recipes here are on the bland side, so there is no tag for that.\n\nUnexplained Exceptions\nFirst exception to these guidelines I still haven't been able to figure out is artichoke dip.  It's mostly cream cheese, with jalapeno's and artichoke hearts.\nIt seems to violate creamy/saucy, but it gets devoured whenever we make it.\nThe other notable exception is mac and cheese.  The cheesy creamy sauce should be off limits.  My working theory is that some of these\nspecific foods have a strong, positive childhood memory or connection.  Does that mean some of these objects aren't in any way related to being on the \nspectrum and are instead just hang-ups from a bad experience?\n","id":"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/guidelines/","title":"Guidelines"},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/":{"body":"","id":"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/","title":"Posts"},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/artichoke-dip/":{"body":"A quintessential potluck item from decades past, it's easy to assemble, travels well and can be re-heated easily.\n\nServe with crackers or little slices of baguette.\n\n2 containers of cream cheese\n1 can of artichoke hearts\n2 jalapeno, seeded and chopped\n1 splash of Worcestershire\n1 C grated Parmesan\n1 C mixed grated cheese of choir - mozerella and jack recommended\n\nMix all but the Parmesan together in a bowl and spread in a large casserole.

Doneness is when the edges start to get crispy or a little brown.\n\n","id":"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/ratatouille/","title":"Ratatouille"},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/salmonrangoon/":{"body":"A much more approachable version of a PF Chang's appetizer.\n\nThe salmon can be off-putting to some, hence the \"strong\" tag.\n\n\nSpring roll/Won Ton wrappers\n1 container of cream cheese\nSmoked salmon (packaged/home made)\nWorcestershire sauce or soy sauce\nneutral cooking oil\n\nThere are generally two types of smoked salmon, locks (cold smoked) and regular (hot smoke), for the purposes of this, the hot smoke has less moisture and turns out better. \nFlake the salmon into a bowl with the cream cheese.\nSplash 2-3 squirts of either Worcestershire or soy.

I have come home from the store on the weekend and pre-cooked 4 meals worth of chicken and 1 meal of hamburgers\nin the same water bath, cutting week-day prep time dramatically.\nCons\n\nIt's a pre-cook method, not a short cut\nit only saves you time at meal prep if you do it ahead of time, in one vat of water.\nThe texture is just wrong.  Meat will always need a sear in a very hot pan.\n\nGeneral observations/experience\nMost sous-vide recipes focus on lean meat, there are other uses...but this is where sous vide shines.\nGood\n\nPork loin: 56c for 1 hour and pan sear medallions for 2 minutes a side to get the texture right\nSteak: 55C with a 2 minutes sear per side when ready to eat. For those wanting well-done, consider slicing up the steak a bit.\nHollandaise: butter and egg yoke at 65C for 20minutes, then blend\nPasteurized eggs: 56C for 30 minutes.  Safe to eat raw cookie dough is the best.\nHamburgers: 55C for one hour\nChicken breasts/thighs: 55C gets you close enough, with a couple minutes of pan time for the right texture\nMash potatoes: 90c for 2hours (not worth it, in my opinion)\nBlanched Peaches: 80c for 2minutes.  This is to loosen the skins for canning.\nCorn: 82C for 30 minutes. This was surprisingly good\n\nThe NOPE list\n\nDon't sous vide fish.  It's like micro-waving it. Just don't.\nLamb leg: 54C for 24 hours - do not repeat, tough, needs fat melting heat\nPork Belly/Bacon: NO. this meat needs fat rendering heat\nTurkey: 63.5 for 24 hours.  Not worth it, Smoke/roasting/deep fry still better.\nNotice a pattern?  anything that usually is good low and slow cooked, won't be with sous-vide.\n\n","id":"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/sousvide/","title":"Sous Vide"},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/wine/":{"body":"Home-made wine is a new area for me, so this will be an over-all place to record lessons.\nIt reminds me quite a bit of my dad's sourdough starter though.\n","id":"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/wine/","title":"Wine"}},"docInfo":{"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/":{"body":185,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/biblography/":{"body":7,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/canning/":{"body":56,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/conversions/":{"body":50,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/guidelines/":{"body":437,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/artichoke-dip/":{"body":67,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/barbacoa/":{"body":247,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/bread-pudding/":{"body":204,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/chicken-involtini/":{"body":108,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/chilli/":{"body":198,"title":3},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/cream-puffs/":{"body":375,"title":4},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/frittata/":{"body":164,"title":3},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/garlicbread/":{"body":87,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/granola/":{"body":123,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/hamburgers/":{"body":131,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/kouign-amann/":{"body":189,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/peach-jack/":{"body":240,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/pear-jam/":{"body":347,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/pulledpork/":{"body":159,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/pumpkinbread/":{"body":138,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/pumpkinpie/":{"body":61,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/quiche/":{"body":215,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/ratatouille/":{"body":261,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/salmonrangoon/":{"body":119,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/saurkrat/":{"body":126,"title":1},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/sriratcha-cucumber-pickles/":{"body":78,"title":3},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/tunamelt/":{"body":92,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/recipes/whitebeansoup/":{"body":166,"title":3},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/sousvide/":{"body":230,"title":2},"https://prjctgeek.github.io/foodie/wine/":{"body":16,"title":1}},"length":31},"lang":"English"};
