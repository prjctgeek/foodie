for writing this\nI thought my wife was a super picky eater.  I love to cook as a hobby, and figured I was up for the challenge.  We had kids.\nKids have mostly the same food hang-ups. \"Learned behaviors\" I hear you muttering.  No, some of this pickiness was baked in.  Some of my co-workers in tech, anicdotily,\nhave similar food prefernece issues.  I started coming up with the (\"rules\")[/rules] to help me make meals that weren't gag-inducing.\nI went looking for others comments on a correlation between food texture objections and being on the spectrum.  I found a paper about the impacts of being on the spectrum to health/wellness. It contains some comments\nfrom participants about texture that sound eerily familar. Maybe I should write down some of what I've learned cooking for three texture obsessed folks.\nWe use the term \"texture sensitive\" to describe these preferences.\nIt's not terribly precise, but hopefully does imparts a level of empathy that I need to get my family to eat.\nI'm recording recipes that have gone over well, and some that haven't. Most are mainstream recipes, with a twist to adapt to a loose set of rules about texture.  As a foodie, these rules violate\nwhat I've learned about good cooking, and so I will put in \"coping mechanism\" add-ons, to serve as side dishes or banned sauces to help the foodie in me enjoy mealtime without resentment.\nyour favorite pickle.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/","title":"Overview post"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/metric/":{"body":"Why are the measurements in metric?\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/metric/","title":"Metric?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/","title":"Posts"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/artichoke-dip/":{"body":"A quintisessial potluck item from decades past, it's easy to assemble, travels well and can be reheated easily.\n\nServe with crakers or little slices of baguette.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/artichoke-dip/","title":"Artichoke dip"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/barbacoa/":{"body":"I've done many a smoked pork shoulder in my day.

Nothing. Sometimes it means not having salad, if the place has pre-mixed  greens.\nIt's not that they \"just don't like dressing\", there will be gagging.\nMany times, it takes a few itterations to correct the order.  It's exhausting.  It's hard to explain to front of house this isn't an alergy, it's texture sensitivity.\nAnother area where this becomes an issue is dishes where the meat is the star of the show, but much of the flavor comes from a sauce.\nFor example, pulled pork.  It's almost always on the dry side, and you pick the sauce based on your preferences to add both flavor and a texture contrast. \nWhen no sauce is acceptable, becuase of it's texture, flavor must be imparted into the meat without a sauce. This is deceptivly difficult when adapting many recipes to the texture sensitive. \nAcidicity and fermentation\nIn \"Salt, fat, acid, heat\", Samine put acid in the title for a reason.  Acidity isn't just for pickles and margaritas,\nit helps counteract heavy, greasy, meat centric dishes.  It's the punch in salad dressing and the zing in yougurt\ntziki. For the purpose of the rules, foods can have some acid, it just can't be front and center.  Because of the 'no sauce' rule, this is actually one of the easier items\nto leave out.\nOne of my other favorite cook books is \"Saving the Seasons\". One of my all time favorites is the bistro carrot pickle.\nAs a foody coping with this strange set of restrictions, I have turned to the pickle on the side of the dish as a coping mechanism.\nThroughout this site, you'll see the tag: 'rule breaker', to denote any recipe that doesn't follow the rules.\nMealy, creamy, squishy\nThis one is hard to pin down.  I first came across it when trying to serve hummas.  Nope, too creamy. Ok, let's try straight up\ngarbonzo beans, no spice, no acid.  Nope: \"Texture is wrong\".  Testing what made beans objectionable, it seems to correlate to size.\nLarge beans, like garbonzo beans, kidney beans, etc, have a \"squishy\", \"mealy\" internal texture that seems to not be present in smaller beans.\nSo black beans were fine.  Refried beans are a gray area, with a layer of cheese or with crispy chips, it might be ok.\nMashed squash (I like delectica) is a no go. How is this different from mashed potatoe texture wise? I still don't get this one.\nMashed potatoes are ok. No idea why, with enough butter and cream to make them whippable, they should be too creamy.\nOne kid doesn't like the texture of rice, while the other one doesn't like potatoes that have skin on, or are sliced too large.\nTomatoes are too runny/squish in the middle, and often slightly acidic, so two strikes against.\nAs many foodies recently, I've experimented cooking with a sous-vide (hot water bath) setup.  My family will not tolerate the texture of meat \nstraight out of the sous-vide.  There are a couple things going on here, I believe: one is that the meat (think tenderloin) is too squishy, and this \nsquishyness is associated with being under-done. \nSpicy or strong flavors\nThis area crosses over with acidity. Of course pickles are out of the question, but even mixing in elements like capers on a sandwhich or a\nsalty kalamata olive is a no go. Cumin, anise, and many other flavors are not tolerated.\nIndian food, korean food, and many other cuisines are frustratingly out of bounds with this rule.\nMany fish is also in the category, as the smell is just too much. Cod in crunchy fish and chips is fine. Salmon is pushing it, and must be cooked without the skin, or smoked.\nUnexplainable Exceptions\nFirst exception to these \"rules\" I still havnen't been able to nail down is artichoke dip.  It's mostly cream cheese, with jalapeno's and artichoke hearts.\nIt seems to break the rules, and it gets devoured whenever we make it.\nThe other notable exception is mac and cheese.  The cheesey creamy sauce seems to be a rule breaker.  My working theory is that some of these\nspecific foods have a strong, positive childhood memory or connetion.  Does that mean some of these objects aren't in any way related to being on the \nspectrum and are instead just hang-ups from a bad experience?  Likely.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/rules/","title":"Rules"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/sousvide/":{"body":"What ?\nSous Vide is putting food in a plastic bag (usually under vacuum) and placing in a water bath to cook.\nThe heater/controller has a temperature set point for the water, and unlike in the oven, the food \nwill never exceed that temperature.\nWhy would you do this?\nIt seals in moisture and flavors, it prevents over-cooking and allows you to pre-cook with precision.\nAlso, it scales up well.  I have come home from Costco on the weekend and pre-cooked 4 meals worth of chicken and 1 meal of hamburgers\nin the same water bath, cutting week-day preptime dramatically.\nCons\n\nIt's a pre-cook method, not a short cut\nit only saves you time at meal prep if you do it ahead of time, in one vat of water.\nThe texture is just wrong.  Meat will always need a sear in a very hot pan.\n\nGeneral observations/expreience\nMost sous-vide recipes focus on lean meat, there are other uses...\nGood\n\nPork loin: 56c for 1 hour and pan sear medallions for 2 min a side to get the texture right\nSteak: 55C with a 2 min sear per side when ready to eat. For those wanting well-done, conside slicing up the steak a bit.\nHollandaise: butter and egg yoke at 65C for 20min, then blend\nPasteurized eggs: 56C for 30 minutes.  Safe to eat raw cookie dough is the best.\nHamburgers: 55C for one hour\nChicken breasts/thighs: 55C gets you close enough, with a couple minutes of pan time for the right texture\nMash potatoes: 90c for 2hours (not worth it, imo)\nBlanched Peaches: 80c for 2min.  This is to loosen the skins for canning.\nCorn: 82C for 30 min. This was surprisingly good\n\nThe NOPE list\n\nDon't sous vide fish.  It's like microwaving it. Just don't.\nLamb leg: 54C for 24 hours - do not repeat, tough, needs fat melting heat\nPork Belly/Bacon: NO. this meat needs fat rendering heat\nTurkey: 63.5 for 24 hours.  Not worth it, Smoke/roasting still better.\nNotice a pattern?  anything that usually is good low and slow cooked, won't be with sous-vide.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/sousvide/","title":"Sous Vide"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":135,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/metric/":{"body":2,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/artichoke-dip/":{"body":17,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/barbacoa/":{"body":81,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/breakfast-for-dinner/":{"body":22,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/hamburgers/":{"body":117,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/pulledpork/":{"body":163,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/sriratcha-cucumber-pickles/":{"body":29,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/recipes/veggies/":{"body":26,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/rules/":{"body":420,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/sousvide/":{"body":223,"title":2}},"length":12},"lang":"English"};
