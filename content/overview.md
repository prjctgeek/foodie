# Texturist


## Reasons for writing this

I thought my wife was a super picky eater.  I love to cook as a hobby, and figured I was up for the challenge.  We had kids.
Kids have mostly the same food hang-ups. "Learned behaviors" I hear you muttering.  No, some of this pickiness was baked in.  Some of my co-workers in tech, anicdotily,
 have similar food prefernece issues. So I went looking for others comments on a correlation between food texture objections and being on the spectrum.

I found a paper about the impacts of being on the spectrum to health/wellness [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6715205/). It contains some comments
from participants about texture that sound eerily familar. Maybe I should write down some of what I've learned cooking for three texture obsessed folks.

So I'm going to coin a phrase here to describe my familie's eating preferences: "texture sensitive".
It's not terribly precise, but hopefully does imparts a level of care and empathy that I need to get my family to eat.
I'm recording recipes that have gone over well, and some that haven't. Most are mainstream recipes, with a twist to adapt to a loose set of "rules" about texture.  As a foodie, these rules violate
 what I've learned about good cooking, and so I will put in "coping mechanism" add-ons, to serve as side dishes or banned sauces to help the foodie in me enjoy mealtime without resentment. Or just get
 a your favorite pickle.

## Over-arching elements to avoid

These are the 'rules' I've come up with to feed my family.  Not all are strictly texture, but there is some cross over.

#### No Sauces

This is usually the first thing others notice about my families eating habbits- when ordering salad at a restruant,
 right off the bat, dry salad, with no dressing.  Nothing. Sometimes it means not having salad, if the place has pre-mixed  greens.
It's not that they "just don't like dressing", there will be gagging.
Many times, it takes a few itterations to correct the order.  It's exhausting.  It's hard to explain to front of house this isn't an alergy, it's a texture preference.

Another area where this becomes an issue is dishes where the meat is the star of the show, but much of the flavor comes from a sauce.
For example, pulled pork.  It's almost always on the dry side, and you pick the sauce based on your preferences to add both flavor and a texture contrast.
When no sauce is acceptable, becuase of it's texture, flavor must be imparted into the meat without a sauce. This is deceptivly difficult when adapting recipes to the texture sensitive.

#### No Acidicity or fermentation

In ["Salt, fat, acid, heat"](https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering-ebook/dp/B01HMXV0UQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GDK12V8E5UO2&keywords=salt%2C+fat%2C+acid%2C+heat&qid=1651629916&s=books&sprefix=salt%2C%2Cstripbooks%2C264&sr=1-1), Samine lays out the pilars of good cooking and aciditiy is in the title for a reason.  Acidity isn't just for pickles and margaritas,
 it helps counteract heavy, greasy, meat centric dishes.  It's the punch in salad dressing and the zing in yougurt
tziki. For my family, food can have _some_ acid, it just can't be front and center.  Because of the 'no sauce' rule, this is actually one of the easier items
 to leave out.

But I love pickles.  I grew up eating my grandmothers watermellon rind pickles and truely enjoy the bite of a good acit hit (that came out wrong).
One of my other favorite cook books, and not just for the pickles, is ["Saving the seasons"](https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Season-Canning-Pickling-Preserving/dp/0307599485/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VZZ05W5RTGCA&keywords=saving+the+seasons&qid=1651630151&s=books&sprefix=saving+the+seasons%2Cstripbooks%2C163&sr=1-1) and I've made so many of the recipes. One of my all time favorites is the bistro carrot pickle.
As a foody coping with this strange set of preference restrictions, I have turned to the pickle on the side of the dish as a coping mechanism.

#### No Mealy, creamy, or squishy textures

This one is hard to pin down.  I first came across it when trying to serve hummas.  Nope, too creamy. Ok, let's try straight up
garbonzo beans, no spice, no acid.  Nope: "Texture is wrong".  Testing what made beans objectionable, it seems to correlate to size.
Large beans, like garbonzo beans, kidney beans, etc, have a "squishy", "mealy" internal texture that seems to not be present in smaller beans.
So black beans were fine.  Refried beans are a gray area, with a layer of cheese or with crispy chips, it might be ok, but maybe not.

Mashed potatoes are ok. No idea why, with enough butter and cream to make them whippable, they should be too creamy.
Mashed squash (I like delectica) is a no go. How is this different from mashed potatoe texture wise? I still don't get this one.

Tomatoes are too runny/squish in the middle, and often slightly acidic, so two strikes against.

As many foodies recently, I've experimented cooking with a sous-vide (hot water bath) setup.  My family will not tolerate the texture of meat
 straight out of the sous-vide.  There are a couple things going on here, I believe: one is that the meat (think tenderloin) is too squishy, and this
 squishyness is associated with being under-done.  I cooked it to medium rare on the tempurature scale, but telling them that doesn't help. My adaptation: slice the
 tenderloin into  medallians and fry in a pan for 2 minutes a side: "Oh now I can it eat it".


#### No Spicy or strong flavors

This area crosses over with acidity.  Of course pickles are out of the question, but even mixing in elements like saurkraut on a sandwhich or a
kimchee flavored soup is a no go. Cumin, anise, tiki masala and many other flavors are not tolerated.
Indian food, korean food, and many other cuisines are frustratingly out of bounds with this rule.

Many fish is also in the category, as the smell stops them even before the texture. Cod in crunchy fish and chips is fine. Salmon is pushing it, and must be cooked without the skin, or smoked. Sushi just gets nervous laughter. Ahi still pink in the middle is "too squishy".


#### Some Unexplainable Exceptions

First exception to these "rules" I still havnen't been able to nail down is artichoke dip.  It's mostly cream cheese, with jalapeno's and artichoke hearts.
It seems to break the rules, and it gets devoured whenever we make it.

The other notable exception is mac and cheese.  The cheesey creamy sauce seems to be a rule breaker.  My working theory is that some of these
 specific foods have a strong, positive childhood memory or connetion.  Does that mean some of these objects aren't in any way related to being on the
 spectrum and are instead just hang-ups from a bad experience?  Likely. When challanged my wife says that cheesey isn't creamy- they are different. sigh.
