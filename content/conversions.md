### What ?

Someday, I'll figure out hoot get this blogging software to auto-populate metric/imperial and serving counts automatically.  Until then, recording some useful conversions here.

### Why?

I scale up/down recipes all the time.  It is a royal pain using imperial measure (get it?).
Metric in the kitchen makes so much more sense, not to mention the whole volume vs weight measure nonsense.


- 1 Cup sugar = 200gr
- 1 Gallon = 3.8L
- Pint jar = 500ml
