A much more approachable version of a PF Chang's apitizer.

- Springroll/WonTon wrappers
- 1 container of cream cheese
- package of smoked salmon
- worchishire sauce or soy sauce


There are generally two types of smoked salmon, lockes (cold smoked) and reglular (hot smoke), for the 
purposes of this, the regular is better. Flake the salmon into a bowl with the cream cheese.
Splash 2-3 squirts of either worchishire or soy.  Mix well; there should be no large chunks of
 salmon.  Heat 2-3 inches of oil in a large pan to at least 150C (300F).

Put a spoonful of the cream cheese mixture into each wrapper and with a wet finger,
 moisten the outer edge of half of the wrapper.  seal them with a pinch (watch some youtube
 videos for various patterns to make it look like you know what you're doing).

Fry in the oil until golden brown and crispy, pull out and rest on a papertowl/drying rack.
