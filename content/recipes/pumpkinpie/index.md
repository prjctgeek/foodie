This recipe is up for review, I'm not certain the creamy texture will pass the testers.

- 3 Egg yolks
- 1 large egg
- 1 can (14oz) sweetened condensed milk
- 1 t cinnamon
- 1/4 t nutmeg
- 9" pie shell

### Steps

1. Head oven to 425F
1. mix all ingredents and bake in a premade shell for 30-40 minutes, when it's just set and a knife in the middle comes out clean.
