Pandemic comfort food for me.

### Ingredients

- 1 can (5oz) tuna
- 1 large flour tortilla
- 1 T Greek yogurt or mayo
- dash of olive oil
- 1 T Parmesean cheese
- dash of Za'atar
- pinch of salt
- 2-3 crimini mushrooms

### Steps

Chop the mushrooms, and combine the fish, yogurt/mayo, cheese, oil, salt and spices in a bowl.
Mix together and spread over half of the tortilla, folding it over.  This is a healthy portion,
  and could easily make two smaller servings.

Saute in olive oil over medium heat, 2-3 minutes a side or until golden brown.


#### Optional add ons

A local falafel shop near me sells a hot sauce called Zhoug (aka Zhug, Shug), made with Serrano peppers and cilantro that pairs really well with this.
