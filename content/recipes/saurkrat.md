Improvement on a recipe from a cookbook that only has 'kraut

<!-- more -->

### Ingredients

- ~50-75g Pink salt
- Head of purple cabbage
- 1 onion
- Burp valve jar lids

take an outer leaf of cabbage off and save as a 'lid'.
Chop the onion and cabbage into thin strips.
Put into a large mixing container after recording the weight of the container
weigh the chopped cabbage/onion, subtract the weight of the container, then multiple by 2.5%

Use the 2.5% number to weight out the salt.
add the salt to the mixture and mix with your hands.
The cabbage will start to 'sweat' after a few minutes of mixing.
Put in a large jar. add ~1C warm water if the cabbage came from the grocery store (not fresh).
Cut the outer leaf into a circle to use as a lid and place it on top of the cabbage.
put a zip lock baggie on top and fill with water as a weight.

put the burp lid on top and set in a warm spot in the kitchen (Seattle isn't a warm place).
Let it ferment for ~2 weeks, then test it and put in the fridge. 

Cook book says it will keep for 6 months. Mine never lasts that long.
