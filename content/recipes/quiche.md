A crispy puff-pastry crust helps sell this.

<!-- more -->

- 1 sheet of pre-made puff-pastry, defrosted
- 1 can whole artichoke hearts
- cooked bacon bits, proscutto or cooked mild sausage
- parsesean cheese
- mozzarella or your favorite cheese blend
- 6-8 eggs
- 1/2 C greek yogurt
- 3-4 fresh basil leaves

1. Pre-heat the oven to 400
1. slice the artichoke in half lengthwise and arrange on a cookie sheet cut side up. Place in the oven while  assempling the quiche.
1. Put down a sheet of parchment paper that's slightly larger than the dish you plan to bake in.  
1. gently roll out the puff pastry on the parchment, stretching it lengthwise to better fit the high sided caserole dish. I recommend using an 11x7, but a 9x9 should also work.
1. genltly lift the parchment and lay in the caserole; we're going to bake the quiche _on_ the parchment.
1. make sure the edges of the puff pastry extend up enough to prevent the egg from touching the sides.  If it doesn't go high enough, you'll need to roll it out some more or find a different casserole.
1. sprinkle your protein of choice, making sure it's cut small enough to be 'bite-sized'
1. evenly sprinkle cheese all over the protien
1. beat 6-8 eggs with greek yogurt until smooth, then gently pour over the cheese, trying not to disturb everything.
1. chop the basil into thin strips and sprinkle eavenly over the top of the quiche.
1. pull the artichoke hearts out of the oven, they should be starting to char
1. place 6-8 artichoke heart slices on top and put the quiche in the oven for 25 minutes, or until it's set.  In my convection oven, I had to turn it a few times for even cooking (most ovens still have hotspots).
