### Ingredients

- 5.6L sliced Peaches
- 40% Sugar (by weight) 
- Clear jel cook type
- Peach juice/water
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp almond extract
- ml Lemon Juice


### Steps

Peel and slice the peaches into a container on a scale (or just weigh and record the weight of the container before and after).

Put the peaches into a large pot on low heat. Add 40% sugar by weight (so 1 kilo of peaches means 400grams of sugar). Add some water (quantity is a guess, depending on how juicy the peaches are) with the goal of creating just enough to fill the jars. (TODO: come up with a better way to measure this) 

Simmer the peaches and sugar for 5 mins on a simmer - the goal is to incorporate the peach juices into the liquid.

Strain peaches from the liquid and put them into jars, leaving about half the jar for liquid and headspeace.

Add the jel powder to the liquid slowly and bring to boil, making sure not to create lumps by dumping it in too fast.  Add lime juice just before pouring into the jars. This is critical to the canning process (unless you have a canning pressure cooker) so err on the side of too much.

Finger tighten the jars and process in a water bath for 10-15.
