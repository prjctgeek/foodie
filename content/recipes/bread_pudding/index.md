This was a Thanksgiving staple when the kids were little.  The dried fruit
 adds texture and breaks up the heaviness.

A word on bread- the best for this recipe is something rich and cake like, e.g. brioche, but white baguette is usually what I've got on hand.
Obviously, wheat bread with nuts should be avoided, but anything else is game, including croissants.

### Ingredients

- 1 Baguette - broken up into bite sized pieces
- 5 eggs
- 1.5 C half and half
- 1 C sugar
- 1 t cinnamon
- 1 t freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 C dried cranberries (raisins, cherries, or blueberries can be substituted)
- orange zest
- 1-2 C dark rum
- pat of butter

### Prep Steps - day before

- If the bread is fresh, you'll need to dry it out. The best method is to leave it out on the counter over-night. In a hurry, my goto method is to set the oven to 200F, spread the bread bits out on a cookie sheet, and place in the oven for ~1 hour (turning off the oven ~30 min in to prevent browning).
- Place the dried fruit in enough rum to cover. Put in the orange zest, leave over-night. The rapid rehydrating step is to cover and heat the fruit/rum in the microwave for 30 seconds and let sit for as long as possible.

### Steps

- Preheat the oven to 350F
- Butter a 9x9 or oval casserole
- Strain out the fruit from the rum, saving the liquid - discard the orange zest
- Mix eggs, sugar, half and half, and 1 t of the rum/fruit juice
- Place the dry bread into the baking dish and sprinkle with cinnamon and fresh nutmeg
- Gently pour the egg mixture over the bread
- evenly sprinkle the fruit over the bread, it should (mostly) sink
- Bake for 45min-1 hour, until a knife comes out clean and the bread on the tops has slightly browned. Give it ~30 minutes to cool.
