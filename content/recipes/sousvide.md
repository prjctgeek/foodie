What is it?


### Pros

### Cons


### General observations/expreience

Don't sous vide fish.  It's like microwaving it. just don't.

The main use case for sous-vide is lean meat.


- Steak: 50 for rare, most will want 55C with a 2 min sear per side when ready to eat.
- Hollandaise: butter and egg yoke at 65C for 20min
- Pasteurized eggs: 56C for 30minutes.  Safe to eat raw cookie dough is the best.
- Hamburgers: 55C for one hour
- Chicken breasts/thighs: 55C gets you close enough, with a couple minutes of pan time for the right texture
- Mash potatoes: 90c for 2hours (not worth it, imo)
- Lamb leg: 54C for 24 hours - do not repeat, tough, needs fat melting heat
- Blanched Peaches: 80c for 2min.  This is to loosen the skins for canning.
- Pork loin: 56c for 1 hour and pan sear medallions for 2 min a side to get the texture right
- Bacon: NO. this meat needs fat rendering heat
- Corn: 82C for 30 min. This was surprisingly good
- Turkey 63.5 for 24 hours.  Not worth it, Smoke/roasting still better.
