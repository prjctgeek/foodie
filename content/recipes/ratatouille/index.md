This goes over well as a vegetable side for people who wouldn't normally eat squash.
And it's pretty, so major points at a pot-luck or Turkey day.

### Ingredients

- 4-5 small-medium yukon gold potatoes (or other waxy, thin skinned potato)
- 2 yellow neck squash
- 2 medium zucchini
- 2 C red sauce
- 1/2 C grated parmesan cheese
- salt
- olive oil
- fresh basil, oregano or thyme (optional)

### Steps

- Cut the potatoes length-wise, with the goal of making them roughly the same half-moon shape as the zucchini when sliced.
- Set your mandolin to about 3-4mm, the goal being to have the potato slices be just a little stiff after par-boiling
- put a pot of water on the stove for boiling the potatoes
- slice the potatoes on the mandolin and place in the boiling water for about 5 minutes.  We don't want them fully cooked, they just need more time than the squash. Drain and rinse the potatoes with cold water to stop the cooking process when done.
- While the potatoes cook, slice the zucchini and yellow squash lengthwise and slice on the mandolin, trying to to make uniform half-moon shapes.
- Arrange the squash slices on a large counter-top and sprinkle lightly with salt. Ideally, they should sweat for about 30 minutes, then blot them dry with paper towels. Since this is the only salt in the dish, we're not going to rinse off or remove what's left of the salt.
- Put some pasta sauce in the bottom of a casserole, to about 1/2 inch.  Sprinkle parmesan cheese over the sauce, and the same with the herbs, if desired.
- arrange the zucchini around the edge of the casserole, with the flat part of the slice immersed in sauce
- working in small batches, arrange the slices in rows with: zucchini,potato, yellow squash,potato, zucchini, etc. This is the tedious part and might require trimming and experimentation to make it look good.
- There will be left over squash; especially the neck of the yellow and bits and ends that don't fit, I usually make a second, smaller dish with the odd bits finely chopped, but otherwise identical to the presentation dish.
- Drizzle a little olive oil on top and spread out with a brush. sprinkle a little more cheese and herbs on top.
- Cover with foil and bake in a 350F oven for about 30 minutes. Because of how labor intensive this is, I usually make it a day ahead, bake it and then before serving, reheat at 375 F for about 15 minutes, uncovered.  Doneness is when the edges start to get crispy or a little brown.
