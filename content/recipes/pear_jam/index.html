Low sugar pear jam is a wonderfully subtle reminder of late summer.

<!-- more -->

By using a thin skinned cooking pear, you can avoid the need for additional pectin, while still getting a proper jammy consistency.

### Ingredients

- 2.3kg Pears (5lbs)
- up to 500gr sugar (2C) - use less if the fruit is ripe
- 2T Lemon juice
- Vanilla, bergamot or cardamom (optional)

### Equipment

- A colander makes this job easier, but you can also use a metal mesh straining bowl in a pinch.
- ~12 1/2pint mason jars, lids and rings

### Steps

Make sure the pears are so ripe they are almost mushy, we're going for as much natural
sugar as possible.

Halve the pears, and using a soup spoon, carve out the seeds and the stems.
Place in a stock pot with ~1 C water and lemon juice.
Simmer for 1 hour on low.

Note: with properly sweet pears, there is a risk of caramelizing or burning them.
Stir them every 10 minutes or so to make sure there is no burning at the bottom of the mixture.
Take the pot off the heat to cool, if adding vanilla, cardamom or bergamot, do it now.

Place a colander or strainer over a large bowl. Working in batches, pour in some
fruit mixture and mash it until most of liquid is pressed out, you should have a dry
 ball of seeds and skins at the end of each batch; discard the solids in the compost.

 Once you have strained out all of the skins, seeds and pithy bits, return to the stock pot
  on low heat. Add sugar to taste, starting with 1/4 cup for a low-sugar version and adding more as needed.
Cook it down on low until it passes the "cold saucer test".

#### Cold Saucer Test

While most of my jam making skills were learned from my Grandmother, the idea of testing
how well the jam will set before jarring I picked up from the excellent book "Saving the Seasons" by Kevin West.

The basic idea is you put a saucer in the freezer for 10-15 minutes, and when you think the jam is ready,
place a small streak (1/2 T) onto the plate.  It should set up into a thick, jammy "gel".
This tells you how think the final product will likely come out and means it's time  to jar.

### Home canning storage

I prefer 1/2 pints for jam, ensuring it gets eaten before it goes off.
Boil some water, and pour into the jars to sanitize for 30 seconds.
Add jam, leaving a half inch of head space.  Be sure to wipe the rims with a clean finger
 to make sure nothing prevents a good seal. Place a lid on the jars and do not over-tighten the rings.

Place in a boiling water bath for 12 min.  When you pull them out, use a pot holder to tighten the rings all the way,
and flip them upside down to cool. I usually do this over-night.

Test the seal by tapping on the lids; they should not "pop" when you press on them, but expect at least
1-2 to fail to seal. Any without a good seal should go into the fridge and be eaten right away.
Store the rest in a cool, dry place for up to 18-24 months.
