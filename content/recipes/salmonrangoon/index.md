- Spring roll/Won Ton wrappers
- 1 container of cream cheese
- Smoked salmon (packaged/home made)
- Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce
- neutral cooking oil


There are generally two types of smoked salmon, locks (cold smoked) and regular (hot smoke), for the purposes of this, the hot smoke has less moisture and turns out better. 

Flake the salmon into a bowl with the cream cheese.
Splash 2-3 squirts of either Worcestershire or soy.  Mix well; there should be no large chunks of
 salmon.  Heat 2-3 inches of oil in a large pan to at least 150C (300F).

Put a spoonful of the cream cheese mixture into each wrapper and with a wet finger,
 moisten the outer edge of half of the wrapper.  seal them with a pinch (watch some YouTube
 videos for various patterns to make it look like you know what you're doing).

Fry in the oil until golden brown and crispy, pull out and rest on a paper towel/drying rack. Note: these don't have to be deep fried, and can be flipped over half way through.
