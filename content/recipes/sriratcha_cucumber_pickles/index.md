Excellent addition to a salad.

<!-- more -->

These are 'refrigerator pickles', not needing a water bath or fermentation.

The pickle juice can actually act as the vinegar in an oil and vinegar dressing on a simple salad.

- 1 English or 4-5 Persian cucumbers, sliced thin on a mandolin
- 1/4 C Sriracha
- 1 C vinegar
- 1 T sesame oil
- 1 shallot
- 1 T sugar

Slice the cucumber and shallot thinly using a mandolin or sharp knife.  Mix the vinegar, oil, sugar and Sriracha. 

Place the cucumbers and shallots in alternating layers in a mason jar.  Pour the brine over, and work out air bubbles by tapping or using a chopstick.

Place in the fridge for a minimum of 24 hours.
