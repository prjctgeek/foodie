In the overview I use pulled pork as an example of "usually dry" food.

My spin on this is to finish off the meat in the oven. Those who are familiar with smoking
 will point out the use of a water pan in the smoker to raise the humidity, but my experience has been
 for the effort involved, this is far more effective.

### Ingredients

- Pork shoulder
- salt
- soy sauce
- 100ml apple cider vinegar
- pepper corns
- bay leaf
- paprika
- chili powder
- several cloves of crushed garlic

### Prep steps

Put the shoulder in a high sided casserole. Rub all over with pink salt, focusing on the non-fat cap sides.

Place uncovered in the fridge for 7 days, flipping over once half way through. You may want to drain the liquid after 24 hours.  

Place in a large container or marination bag and add: 400ml of an acid (usually apple cider vinegar), a 200ml of a salt solution (usually soy sauce), the herbs, and then water to cover.
Make sure the meat is completely submerged, and put back in the fridge for 24-48 hours.

Smoke for four hours with pecan chips at 250F.  Move to a covered container and add about 100ml of water. Cook in the oven at 325 for 4 more hours, always covered.
Once done, it will be falling apart- remove the fat and bone and pull with forks.

These make great tacos, sliders and a myriad of other dishes. I generally portion out about 400gr into vacuum seal bags for freezing and only immediately eat what the last 
bit that doesn't make the 400gr bar.
