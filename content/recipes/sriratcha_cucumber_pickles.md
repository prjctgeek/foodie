Excellent addtion to a salad, and the brine can act as the acid. 

<!-- more -->
These are 'refrigerator pickles', not needing a water bath or fermentation.
They really can ~~rest~~ for as little as 24 hours before enjoying.  The picle juice
 can actually act as the vinegar in an oil and vinegar dressing on a simple salad.

- 1 cucumber, sliced thin on a mandolin
- 1/4 C sriratcha
- 1 C vinegar
- 1 T seaseme oil
- 1 shallot
- 1 T sugar

Slice the cucumber and shallot thinly using a mandoline or sharp knife.  Mix the vinegar, oil, sugar and sriratcha.
