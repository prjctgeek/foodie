Excellent addtion to a salad, and the brine can act as the acid. 

<!-- more -->
These are 'refrigerator pickles', not needing a water bath or fermentation.
They really can rest for as little as 24 hours before enjoying.  The picle juice
 can actually act as the vinegar in an oil and vinegar dressing on a simple salad.

- 1 cucumber, sliced thin on a mandolin
- 1/4 C sriratcha
- 1 C vinegar
- 1 T seaseme oil
