Why is something so simple and well understood as a Hamburger here?

Well, referring to the [guidelines](/guidelines), we're not going to put sauce, Mayonnaise, relish, etc on these.  How do we turn a dry hockey-puck of meat into something tasty as-is?

My solution is two fold: add fat and flavor to the meat then use sous-vide.

### Ingredients

- 500g 80/20 hamburger 
- If using leaner meat, add 1-2 pats of softened butter 
- 20g bread crumbs or panko
- 10g Parmesan cheese
- dash of A1
- dash of salt
- 1 egg


Mix together all ingredients by hand, it should be on the 'wet' side
 with the egg.  For big eaters, I portion out 170g per burger, which should yield about 3.
 For normal portion sizes, ~130g should get you to 4 burgers.  

(optional) Place in vacuum seal bags and Sous-vide at 55C for an hour. Store in the refrigerator/freezer until needed.  To prepare, sear on high heat for ~2minutes per side.

If not sous-vide, cook as per the usual food safety recommendation: 62C/145F in the middle.

Serve on a toasted bun.

As mentioned in the [guidelines](/guidelines), some of the kids don't like skin on potatoes, so for fries, we just buy pre-made-made. A bit of a compromise, but it is a bit of work to do fries from scratch.
