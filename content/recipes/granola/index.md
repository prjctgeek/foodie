My take on granola, usually just mixed 50/50 with plain Greek yogurt.

While we're not big ceral with milk eaters, treating this as a topping on other things
 can work.

Obviously, there is quite a bit of room for substitutions.  Different nuts,
 dried fruit or extracts are all an option.  Sugar levels can be decreased as well, but
 the fat helps bind and crispen the final result.

### Ingredients

- 3 C old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1/3 C chopped pistachios
- 1 t salt
- 1 t cinnamon
- dusting of nutmeg
- 1/2 t almond extract or good quality vanilla
- 1/2 C coconut oil
- 1/4 C brown sugar or honey
- 1 C dried cranberries

### Steps

Preheat oven to 325F. In a large bowl, mix the oats, nuts and dry spices.
In a separate glass measuring cup, mix the oil and sugar.  Heat until the fat
 has melted.  Stir in the almond or vanilla flavoring and then pour over the oat mixture.

Put in a large casserole and spread thin, bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
After cooling down, stir in the dried fruit.
