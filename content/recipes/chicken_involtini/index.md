Mini meat rolls.

<!-- more -->

While there is sauce, it's hidden inside, so it might get a pass as seasoning.

### Ingredients

- Chicken breasts or thighs (preferred, although tougher to work with)
- Mozzerella
- Proscutto
- bit of pesto

##### Thighs prep

Slice the meat so it can be rolled out, (see pic).  Cut the thigh in half after removing the bone- and use the thinner side for something else.

##### Breast meat prep

For breast meat, putting it in a zip lock or vacuum seal bag and pounding it a bit helps. You can also prep cook this a bit by using sous-vide on the pounded breasts, see the [sous vide guide](/sousvide) for more.  You don't want it too thin or it won't hold together.

#### Assemble

Lay out procutto, a smear of pesto and a chunk of mozzerrella.

Gently roll it up, for thighs you might barely get it to close. Using a wet toothpick or bamboo skewer through the side of the roll might help it hold together better.

Bake in the oven for 30 min (raw) at 350F or 15 min (sous vide) at 375F.
