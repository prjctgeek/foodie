Frittata: 
- bacon, 
- 1 medium onion
- 10 eggs
- splash of half and half
- Parm
- mozzarella
- basil
- roasted artichoke hearts


Set the ove to 400 F to pre-heat

Halve some artichoke hearts and place on a cookie sheet.  Place in the oven while it's pre-heating

Using a 10 imch cast iron pan, brown/render diced bacon.
Scoope out the bacon, leaving the fat in the pan.  Sweat the onions and garlic in the 
rendered bacon fat for a few minutes.

Crack the eggs and add cream while the onions cook. (optional) Whip with an immersion blender 
for 1 min to add some air to the mixture.

Once the onions are translucent, add the bacon back in and turn off the heat.
Add the cheese, carefully spreading it evenly, then gently pour in the egg mixture,
trying not to disturb the cheese/bacon.  

Remove the Artichoke hearts from the oven, they should be starting to darken.

While the residual heat in the pan is cooking the outer edge of the frittata, place a few
 artichoke hearts on top gently.

Place in the oven for ~15 minutes, or until the egg has set and the top should be brown.
Test by inserting a knife in the middle, it should come out clean.


As an aside, any leftover artichoke hearts can be hollowed out and stuffed with cream cheese, bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and baked along side the frittata.
