I've done many a smoked pork shoulder in my day.  They almost always get devoured, even
 with no sauce (see the rules). My pattern is: 7 day dry age, marinade in: an acid (usually apple cider vinegar),
 a salt solution (usually soy sauce), with some herbs. Smoke for four hours with pecan chips at 250F.  Move to the oven
 at 325 for 4 more hours.

When I volunteered to cook a taco bar lunch for the teaching staff at my wife's school, I decided I needed
something a little more authentic.  I did a practice barbacoa pork shoulder and was impressed-
without sauce, this is way better than traditional pulled pork. Juicy, a little bit of heat in the back of the
mouth, but with a little cheese, could be toned down.

### Ingredients

- Bone-in pork shoulder

#### Marinade

- Can of chipotle peppers in adobo
- 1 onion
- 1 head of garlic
- 10 cloves
- 4 bay leaves
- 500ml stock
- 200gr pink salt
- juice of 3-4 limes

### Prep steps

Place the port shoulder in a high sided casserole, fat cap down. Rub it all over with pink salt and place it in the refrigerator to dry out 1 week.

Wash off the salt by gentle rubbing it all over with a wet hand.

(Optional) Smoke for 4 hours at 225F with pecan chips. If you don't want to  bother, add a few splashes of liquid smoke to the marinade.

Place in a marinade bag or large bowl, fat cap down.  Pour marinade all over it and add water or more stock to cover. Tie
 the marinade bag or cover with a lid- we don't want it to dry any more.
Let rest in fridge for 24-48 hours.

Move the pork to an instant pot/pressure cooker fat cap up.  Pour the marinade over it to cover.  Pressure cook for 3 hours.

Remove the meat from the pot and pull it apart, removing the bone, fat and any connective tissue.

Strain the liquid from the pressure cooker.  Taste it- if it's super spicy or salty, thin with water to taste, then add
 back to the meat 1-200ml.
