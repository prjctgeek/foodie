I've done many a smoked pork shoulder in my day.  They almost always get devoured, even
 with no sauce (see the rules). My pattern is: 7 day dry age, marinade in: an acid (usually apple cider vinegar),
 a salt solution (usually soysauce), with some herbs. Smoke for four hours with pecan chips at 250F.  Move to the oven
 at 325 for 4 more hours.

When I volunteered to cook a taco bar lunch for the teaching staff at my wife's school, I decided I needed
something a little more authentic.  I did a practice barbacoa pork shoulder and was impressed-
without sauce, this is way better than traditional pulled pork. Juicy, a little bit of heat in the back of the
mouth, but with a little cheese, could be toned down.
