I've done many a smoked pork shoulder in my day.  They almost always get devoured, even
 with no sauce (see the rules). My pattern is: 7 day dry age, marinade in: an acid (usually apple cider vinegar),
 a salt solution (usually soysauce), with some herbs. Smoke for four hours with pecan chips at 250F.  Move to the oven
 at 325 for 4 more hours.

When I volunteered to cook a taco bar lunch for the teaching staff at my wife's school, I decided I needed
something a little more authentic.  I did a practice barbacoa pork shoulder and was impressed-
without sauce, this is way better than traditional pulled pork. Juicy, a little bit of heat in the back of the
mouth, but with a little cheese, could be toned down.

### Ingredients

- Bone-in pork shoulder

#### Marinade

- Can of chipotle peppers in adobo
- 1 onion
- 200gr pink salt
- lime juice

### Prep steps

Dry age the pork shoulder by rubbing it all over with salt and putting in a high sided caserole dish
 to  dry in the fridge for about 1 week.

Wash off the salt by gentle rubbing it all over with a wet hand.

(Optional) Smoke for 4 hours at 225F with pecan chips. If you don't want to  bother,
 add a few splashes of liquid smoke to the marinade.

Place in a marinade bag or large bowl, fat cap down.  Pour marinade all over it and cover or tie
 the marinade bag- we don't want it to dry any more.
Let rest in fridge for 24-48 hours.

Move the pork to an instantpot/pressure cooker fat cap up.  Pour the marinade over it and ~200ml of
 water.  Pressure cook for 3 hours (on meat setting for instantpot).

Remove the meat from the pot and pull it apart, removing the bone, fat and any connective tissue.
Strain the liquid from the pressure cooker.  Taste it- if it's super spicy or salty, thin with water to taste, then add
 back to the meat 1-200ml.
