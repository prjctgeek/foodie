We got some smoked pork neck bones from a friend and I thought I'd take a crack at making soup with them.

<!-- more -->
The beans used were Great Northern beans, which are small enough to not be [mealy](/guidelines).

Navy beans or lentils would also work, but for lentils the second cook time would be much less (15min for brown/green).

### Ingredients

- 1 pound of dry small white beans (Great northern or navy)
- 500 gr smoked port bones (neck, hocks, etc)
- 2L stock, pork preferred, but chicken or veg will work
- 1 medium yellow onion
- 1 small carrot
- 2-3 celery stalks
- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 bay leaves

### Steps

- In your instant pot liner, over the stove, add  some olive oil and sweat the chopped onion for a few minutes.
- Make a mirepoix: add in diced celery and carrot and cook a few more minutes
- Add garlic, stock, bay leaves and pork.  If the stock quantity doesn't add up to 2L, be sure to fill the gap with water.
- Seal the Instant pot and cook on meat setting for 30 minutes
- open the Instant pot and taste the broth- depending on if the Pork was salted or not, you may need to add some.
- Add in the beans, re-seal and cook for 1 hour on the beans setting.

### The strong version

Some ideas for things that would make this more interesting include: diced jalapeno's, kale, loads of black pepper, or Chipotle hot sauce - all the end after the beans are cooked.

[Garlic bread](/recipes/garlicbread/) would also help as a flavor and texture contrast.
