Why are you putting something so simple and well understood as a Hamburger?
Well, referring to the [rules](rules), we're not going to put sauce, mayo, relish, etc on these.  
How do you turn a dry hocky-puck of meat into something tasty as-is?

My solution is two fold: add fat and flavor to the meat and souse-vide.

### Ingredients

- 500g 80/20 hamburger 
- If using leaner meat, add 1-2 pats of softened butter 
- 20g bread crumbs
- 10g parmesean cheese
- dash of A1
- dash of salt
- 1 egg


Mix together all ingredients by hand, it should be on the 'wet' side
 with the egg.  For big eaters, I portion out 170g per burger, which should yeild about 3.
 For normal portion sizes, ~130gr should get you to 4 burgers.  

Souse-vide at 55C for an hour. Store in the fridge until mealtime, then sear on high heat for ~2min per side.

Serve on a toasted bun.
