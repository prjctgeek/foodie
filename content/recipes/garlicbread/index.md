Served as a common side, it's crunchy, cheesy, and garlicky

### Ingredients

- Regular wheat bread, baguette, or pre-made pizza dough
- Parmesan cheese
- 2-3 cloves of garlic
- 1 stick Butter or Ghee

Chop the garlic into small chunks.
Melt the butter in a ramekin and let the garlic steep a few minutes in the hot butter

If using pizza dough, cut into palm sized chunks and roll out into long strands.

Line a cookie sheet with parchment or non-stick spray, then flatten the dough on a cookie sheet.

Spread garlic and butter over carbohydrate choice and sprinkle liberally with grated Parmesan.
My family does not approve of the sprinkling Parmesan on top, so I only do one for myself.

Put in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes or until Parmesan just starts to brown
