Nothing terribly special about this Chili, other than the lack of spice.
<!-- more -->

I scaled this up for a volunteer catering event to feed the staff of an elementary school.  For 45 people it nearly maxed out my little instant pot when cooking the beans.

### Ingredients

- 560gr Cooked/canned black beans or 200gr dry black beans
- 1 chopped onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 500gr of protein - I like stew meat (optionally substitute hamburger)
- 1 can of crushed tomatoes (12-14 Oz)
- 1.5T chili powder
- 1 T oregano
- 1 T basil
- 1 Bay leaf (optional)
- 1 T red wine vinegar
- diced bell/hatch/jalapeno (optional)
- sour cream (optional)

Makes 6 servings.


#### Beans

For dry beans, setup the instant pot with beans, double the volume of water or stock, a clove of garlic and a bay leaf.
Set the instant pot for beans, cook for an hour.

If using canned beans, not much to do- just open the can (they aren't as flavorful though).

The liquid for either method should go into the final pot, it acts as a thickener.

#### Meat

In the instant pot (after removing beans), put it on saute and brown the meat.

If using stew meat, add 1C of beef stock and 1 clove of garlic and 1 bay leaf, and cook on 'meat' for 35 minutes.
For regular hamburger, just brown it.

#### Final assembly

Mix the beans and meat (minus the bay leaves) in a large pot, together with the remaining ingredients: tomatoes, garlic, spices, vinegar.
Cook down for about 30 minutes on a simmer, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn't burn. A quick smash with a potatoes masher helps, but resist the urge to pull out the immersion blender.

Bell pepper, jalapeno, and sour cream are all optional final condiments.
Corn bread or Fritos are also a great optional add-on.
