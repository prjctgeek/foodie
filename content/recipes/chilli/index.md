Nothing terribly special about this Chilli, other than the lack of spice.
<!-- more -->

I scaled this up for a volunteer catering event to feed the staff of an elementary school.  For 45 people it nearly maxed out my little instant pot when cooking the beans.

### Ingredients

- 560gr Cooked/canned black beans or 200gr dry black beans
- 1 chopped onion
- 2 clovers of garlic
- 500gr of protein - I like stew meat (optionally substitute hamburger)
- 1 can of crushed tomatoes (24oz?)
- 1.5T chilli powder
- 1 T oregano
- 1 T basil
- 1 T red wine vinegar
- diced bell pepper and/or jalapeno (optional)
- sour cream (optional)


#### Beans

For dry beans, setup the instant pot with beans, double the volume of water, a clove of garlic and a bay leaf.
Set the instant pot for beans, cook for an hour.

If using canned beans, not much todo- just open the can (they aren't as flavorful though).


#### Meat

In the instant pot (after the beans), put it on saute and brown the stew meat.
Add 1C of beef stock and 1 clove of garlic and 1 bay leaf, and cook on 'meat' for 35 minutes.

#### Final assembly

Mix the beans and meat (minus the bay leaves) in a large pot, together with the remaining ingredients: tomatoes, garlic, spices, vinegar.
Cook down for about 30 min on a simmer, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn't burn. A quick smash with a potatoe masher helps, but resist the urge to pull out the immersion blender.

Bell pepper, jalapeno, and sour cream are all optional final condiments.
Corn bread or fritos are also a great optional add-on.
