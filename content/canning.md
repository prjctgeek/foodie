### Lost art?

There are many articles about canning, and I mostly learned it from my mother/grandmother, so surely it's not completely lost?

But when I talk about doing home canning at work/social interactions, everyone seems surprised at this knowledge.

For the purposes of texture though, canned food is usually a hard pass, unless it is an ingredient to something else.
