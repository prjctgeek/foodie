### Lost art?

There are many articles about canning, and I mostly learned it from my mother/grandmother, so surely it's not completely lost?

But when I talk about doing home canning at work/social interactions, everyone seems surprised at this knowledge.

### Favorite recipes that need recording

- Jam. Strawberry-rhubarb is my childhood favorite, and I still make it all the time.
- Pickles
- Pasta Sauce
- Pie fillings
