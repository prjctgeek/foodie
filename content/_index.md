## Hangups

My wife is a super picky eater.  I love to cook as a hobby, and figured I was up for the challenge.  We had kids.
Kids have mostly the same food hang-ups. "Learned behaviors" I hear you muttering.  No, some of this pickiness was baked in.  Some of my co-workers in tech, anecdotally, have similar food  issues.  We started coming up with some ["guidelines"](/guidelines) to help me make meals that weren't gag-inducing. This site is just a random collection of some of the recipes that went over well and some that didn't.

On my journey to understand what's going on, I came across the term to capture this: "sensory aversion".
### Sensory Aversion


There seems to be a correlation between food texture issues and neurodivergence; affecting those that might not (yet) think of themselves as neurodivergent.
Coming to terms with this idea was helpful for me. Here are some more articles on the topic:

_NOTE:_ This is Pommes Anna. She's pretty, but the texture did not go over well, so not including a recipe for it.
