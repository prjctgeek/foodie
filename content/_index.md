## Why?

My wife is a super picky eater.  I love to cook as a hobby, and figured I was up for the challenge.  We had kids.
Kids have mostly the same food hang-ups. "Learned behaviors" I hear you muttering.  No, some of this pickiness was baked in.  Some of my co-workers in tech, anecdotally, have similar food preference issues.  We started coming up with some ["guidelines"](/guidelines) to help me make meals that weren't gag-inducing.

Being curious about these habbits, we went looking for a correlation between food texture objections and neurodivergence.  We found a [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6715205/) about the impacts of being on the spectrum to health and wellness. It contains some comments
from participants about texture that sound familiar. Maybe we should write down some of what we've learned cooking for three "sensory sensitivite" folks. Or maybe it's just nice to have an online collection of recipes.


## What

We're recording recipes that have gone over well, and some that haven't. Most are mainstream recipes, with a twist to adapt to our [guidelines](/guidelines) about texture.  As a foodie, some of these violate
 what I've learned about good cooking, and so I will put in coping recipes with the tag "[gross](/tags/gross)", to serve as side dishes or banned items to help the foodie in me enjoy mealtime without resentment.

_NOTE:_ the Pommes Anna did not go over well, so while it's pretty- not including a recipe for it.
