# Texturist


## Reasons for writing this

I thought my wife was a super picky eater.  I love to cook as a hobby, and figured I was up for the challenge.  We had kids.
Kids have mostly the same food hang-ups. "Learned behaviors" I hear you muttering.  No, some of this pickiness was baked in.  Some of my co-workers in tech, anicdotily,
 have similar food prefernece issues. So I went looking for others comments on a correlation between food texture objections and being on the spectrum.

I found a paper about the impacts of being on the spectrum to health/wellness [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6715205/). It contains some comments
from participants about texture that sound eerily familar. Maybe I should write down some of what I've learned cooking for three texture obsessed folks.

So I'm going to coin a phrase here to describe my familie's eating preferences: "texture sensitive".
It's not terribly precise, but hopefully does imparts a level of care and empathy that I need to get my family to eat.
I'm recording recipes that have gone over well, and some that haven't. Most are mainstream recipes, with a twist to adapt to a loose set of "rules" about texture.  As a foodie, these rules violate
 what I've learned about good cooking, and so I will put in "coping mechanism" add-ons, to serve as side dishes or banned sauces to help the foodie in me enjoy mealtime without resentment. Or just get
 a your favorite pickle.
