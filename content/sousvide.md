## What ?

Sous Vide is putting food in a plastic bag (usually under vacuum) and placing in a water bath to cook.
The heater/controller has a temperature set point for the water, and unlike in the oven, the food 
will never exceed that temperature.   

## Why would you do this?

It seals in moisture and flavors, it prevents over-cooking and allows you to pre-cook with precision.
Also, it scales up really well.  I have come home from the store on the weekend and pre-cooked 4 meals worth of chicken and 1 meal of [hamburgers](recipes/hamburgers)
 in the same water bath, cutting week-day prep time dramatically.

### Cons

- It's a pre-cook method, not a short cut
- it only saves you time at meal prep if you do it ahead of time, in one vat of water.
- The texture is just wrong.  Meat will always need a sear in a very hot pan.


### General observations/experience

Most sous-vide recipes focus on lean meat, there are other uses...but this is where sous vide shines.

#### Good

- Pork loin: 56c for 1 hour and pan sear medallions for 2 minutes a side to get the texture right
- Steak: 55C with a 2 minutes sear per side when ready to eat. For those wanting well-done, consider slicing up the steak a bit.
- Hollandaise: butter and egg yoke at 65C for 20minutes, then blend
- Pasteurized eggs: 56C for 30 minutes.  Safe to eat raw cookie dough is the best.
- [Hamburgers](recipes/hamburgers): 55C for one hour
- Chicken breasts/thighs: 55C gets you close enough, with a couple minutes of pan time for the right texture
- Mash potatoes: 90c for 2hours (not worth it, in my opinion)
- Blanched Peaches: 80c for 2minutes.  This is to loosen the skins for canning.
- Corn: 82C for 30 minutes. This was surprisingly good

#### The NOPE list

- Don't sous vide fish.  It's like micro-waving it. Just don't.
- Lamb leg: 54C for 24 hours - do not repeat, tough, needs fat melting heat
- Pork Belly/Bacon: NO. this meat needs fat rendering heat
- Turkey: 63.5 for 24 hours.  Not worth it, Smoke/roasting/deep fry still better.
- Notice a pattern?  anything that usually is good low and slow cooked, won't be with sous-vide.
