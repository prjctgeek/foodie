## Over-arching elements to avoid

#### Sauces

This is usually the first thing others notice about my families eating habbits- when ordering salad at a restruant,
 right off the bat, dry salad, with no dressing.  Nothing. Sometimes it means not having salad, if the place has pre-mixed  greens.
It's not that they "just don't like dressing", there will be gagging.
Many times, it takes a few itterations to correct the order.  It's exhausting.  It's hard to explain to front of house this isn't an alergy, it's texture sensitivity.

Another area where this becomes an issue is dishes where the meat is the star of the show, but much of the flavor comes from a sauce.
For example, pulled pork.  It's almost always on the dry side, and you pick the sauce based on your preferences to add both flavor and a texture contrast. 
When no sauce is acceptable, becuase of it's texture, flavor must be imparted into the meat without a sauce. This is deceptivly difficult when adapting many recipes to the texture sensitive. 

#### Acidicity and fermentation

In ["Salt, fat, acid, heat"](https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering-ebook/dp/B01HMXV0UQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2161LOJRKFXM9&keywords=salt%2C+fat%2C+acid%2C+heat&qid=1651765830&sprefix=salt%2C+fat%2Caps%2C268&sr=8-1), Samine put acid in the title for a reason.  Acidity isn't just for pickles and margaritas,
 it helps counteract heavy, greasy, meat centric dishes.  It's the punch in salad dressing and the zing in yougurt
tziki. For the purpose of the rules, foods can have _some_ acid, it just can't be front and center.  Because of the 'no sauce' rule, this is actually one of the easier items
 to leave out.

One of my other favorite cook books is "Saving the Seasons". One of my all time favorites is the bistro carrot pickle.
As a foody coping with this strange set of restrictions, I have turned to the pickle on the side of the dish as a coping mechanism.

Throughout this site, you'll see the tag: 'rule breaker', to denote any recipe that doesn't follow the rules.

#### Mealy, creamy, squishy

This one is hard to pin down.  I first came across it when trying to serve hummas.  Nope, too creamy. Ok, let's try straight up
garbonzo beans, no spice, no acid.  Nope: "Texture is wrong".  Testing what made beans objectionable, it seems to correlate to size.
Large beans, like garbonzo beans, kidney beans, etc, have a "squishy", "mealy" internal texture that seems to not be present in smaller beans.
So black beans were fine.  Refried beans are a gray area, with a layer of cheese or with crispy chips, it might be ok.

Mashed squash (I like delectica) is a no go. How is this different from mashed potatoe texture wise? I still don't get this one.

Mashed potatoes are ok. No idea why, with enough butter and cream to make them whippable, they should be too creamy.
One kid doesn't like the texture of rice, while the other one doesn't like potatoes that have skin on, or are sliced too large.

Tomatoes are too runny/squish in the middle, and often slightly acidic, so two strikes against.

As many foodies recently, I've experimented cooking with a sous-vide (hot water bath) setup.  My family will not tolerate the texture of meat 
 straight out of the sous-vide.  There are a couple things going on here, I believe: one is that the meat (think tenderloin) is too squishy, and this 
 squishyness is associated with being under-done. 


#### Spicy or strong flavors

This area crosses over with acidity. Of course pickles are out of the question, but even mixing in elements like saurkraut on a sandwhich or a
kimchee flavored soup is a no go. Cumin, anise, and many other flavors are not tolerated.

Indian food, korean food, and many other cuisines are frustratingly out of bounds with this rule.

Many fish is also in the category, as the smell is just too much. Cod in crunchy fish and chips is fine. Salmon is pushing it, and must be cooked without the skin, or smoked.


#### Unexplainable Exceptions

First exception to these "rules" I still havnen't been able to nail down is [artichoke dip](recipes/artichoke-dip).  It's mostly cream cheese, with jalapeno's and artichoke hearts.
It seems to break the rules, and it gets devoured whenever we make it.

The other notable exception is mac and cheese.  The cheesey creamy sauce seems to be a rule breaker.  My working theory is that some of these
 specific foods have a strong, positive childhood memory or connetion.  Does that mean some of these objects aren't in any way related to being on the 
 spectrum and are instead just hang-ups from a bad experience?  Likely.
